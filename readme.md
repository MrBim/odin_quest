Odin Quest

this is a little top down adventure game featuring VIKINGS.
its going to look pretty blocky

it is basicly an investigation in to using the html canvas and javascript

therefore i havent used any packages or librarys. 


current controlls are 

direction buttons:- move the player in their respective directions 

ctrl:- is the action button (currently this is for going thru doors but i have more plans for it in the future) 

space:- fires lightening (use you imagination that yellow square is thor's powerful lightening, trust me)


you should get points for killing the ice giants (at the moment you also get points for throwing lightening)

ice giants respawn when you go in to a different room

there is a button to mute the horrible music

q respawns a new ice giant and resets the score as well as re enabling the horrible music.
