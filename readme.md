Odin Quest

this is a little top down adventure game featuring VIKINGS.
its going to look pretty blocky

it is basicly an investigation in to using the html canvas and javascript

therefore i havent used any packages or librarys. 


current controlls are 

direction buttons:- move the player in their respective directions 

ctrl:- is the action button (currently this is for going thru doors but i have more plans for it in the future) 

space:- fires lightening (use you imagination that yellow square is thor's powerful lightening, trust me)
